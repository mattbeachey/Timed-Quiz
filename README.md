# Timed-Quiz

Live link: https://mattbeachey.github.io/Timed-Quiz/

This timed multiple-choice game starts a timer as soon as the user presses "start game" and then presents them with a series of five questions. Each wrong answer deducts 15 seconds from the clock, and each correct answer scores points equivalent to how many seconds remain on the clock. After all five questions are answered, or the time runs outâ€”whichever comes first, the game ends and the user's score is tallied.

The user is then prompted to enter their name, which will be added with their score on a high scores list, ranked from highest to lowest. This high scores list is stored in local storage. 

The app is dynamically designed and is suitable for phones and tablets as well as computers.
